Hi Matthew and Tjelvar, cc James
 
Thank you for taking a look at our data!
 
I agree it would be good to meet up for a quick chat next week - how about Thursday 14th at 10am? I’ll send an invite. I’d like to understand about more about what the PCA shows and how that lets you determine “yellowness”. We can also discuss the plot ordering so you can have the real line IDs for the analysis.
 
Answers to your questions:
 
1.      How much are you interested in absolute quantification at a given time point versus differences between time points?
 
We are much more interested in differences between time-points than absolute values. In the end we would like to rank the plots (wheat lines) to see which are the earliest and latest senescing. For example we could make a threshold when the plot is 50 % yellow (or whatever threshold makes sense like % green lost or is easier to measure reliably), and then rank the different plots for how long it takes them to pass this threshold. Since we will only be taking photos every week or so some might pass this threshold in between time-points – would we be able to extrapolate between time-points or do you think that will be too unreliable?
 
2.      As you mention, the plot numbers are hard to see in some of the images - do you know from the filenames/GPS data what the positions are? It might end up being hard to work out otherwise.
When I take the photos I always take them in the same order so that could be a better way to tell the plots apart. They are numbered in ascending order e.g. “DJI_0117.jpg”, “DJI_0118.jpg” etc . Occasionally there is a missing number which could happen if by mistake I take 2 photos of the same plot I will delete the duplicated photo. That way the same plots will be in the same order (but the numbers might not be consecutive). Would that work?
 
Also for the files do you just need the .jpg or are you using the .dng raw files? If you don’t need the dng files I can stop recording them.
 
3. Do you have any ground level measure of senescence that can be compared with that derived from image analysis? 
Yes we will have a visual score. We are scoring when 25 % of the flag leaves have senesced which we hope will correlate with the yellowness on the photos (the flag leaf is the top leaf so should cover a large proportion of the visible plot). The scoring is underway but < 5 % of lines have senesced so far. I expect the dataset will be complete in the next 3-4 weeks (weather dependent). I have the visual score data from last year (same lines) which you could try using as a test although there will be environmental variation from last year to this year. Let me know if it might be useful and I can send it.
 
Thanks for the link to the shared folder- I have put our 1st set of images in there. I plan to take more photos on Friday so I will add those once I have them.
 
I also put into that folder an excel file showing what the IDs of the plots are within each photo. The layout file shows that photos are ordered from 1 to 60 in red numbers. The plots to the left of the red number are included in that photo (6 wide by 5 tall). When I took the photos I went in that order from 1 to 60 but the exact photo file names go from 117 to 178 (two files were deleted because they were duplicates). Sorry it’s a bit confusing – it’ll probably make more sense to explain in person!
 
Kind regards,
 
Philippa

Hi Philippa,
 
We’re well (and enjoying the sunshine!) - hope you are too. We’ve been looking at your data, and have made some progress on analysis. I’m CCing in Tjelvar who’s done most of the work so far.
 
The attached image shows some components of the analysis, in particular:
 
1. An image showing identification of the plots (these are the only parts of the image that are coloured in), with a breakdown of the colour values for the mean colour for that plot.
2. PCA analysis, looking at those mean colours to try to identify a yellow/green scale for quantifying senescence.
3. An image in which the most extremal plot on this axis (i.e. what we’d classify as the most yellow) is highlighted.
 
I think this gives a way to score yellowness for each of the plots (based on some combination of the principal components). Some things that would be useful to know/think about:
 
1. How much are you interested in absolute quantification at a given time point versus differences between time points?
 
2. As you mention, the plot numbers are hard to see in some of the images - do you know from the filenames/GPS data what the positions are? It might end up being hard to work out otherwise.
 
3. Do you have any ground level measure of senescence that can be compared with that derived from image analysis? 
 
I’ve created a shared folder at:
 
\\nbi-group-data\jic-research-groups\matthew-hartley\incoming\philippa
 
to which both you and James should have write access. This should have plenty of space for further images. It might be good to meet up for a quick chat to talk through this sometime next week. We’re going to be moving over to Bateson during the next 3 weeks as well, which will make everything quite chaotic for a while (and consume quite a bit of our time unfortunately) but after that at least we’ll be closer!
 
Best,
 
Matthew

Hi Matthew
 
Hope you’re well.
 
We’ve taken photos for the first timepoint in our senescence experiment in the field. These photos include the colour chart and number for each plot as we discussed previous. Not all of these labels can be seen perfectly but hopefully they will be somewhat useful!
 
Please would you be able to take a look at the photos and try some image analysis on them?
 
In the end we would like to score % of yellow and % green in each plot at each timepoint, and therefore work out a rate of yellowing as a way to measure senescence. A few plots have already started to go yellow e.g. the bottom left of DJI_0122.jpg but most (>90 %) are still at “peak” green-ness so these photos will be our baseline.
 
I attach a couple of examples in .jpg format. In each photo we are interested in 6 plots across by 5 plots down (boxed in red in the image “annotated_photo”). These lie between the two white markers on the right hand side.
 
These photos are from timepoint “0”. I plan to take more photos approximately every week. In the end we will probably have ~6 timepoints. At each timepoint we have 60 photos (I didn’t include all of them because I didn’t want to fill up your inbox but I can send them over if they’ll be helpful). Each photo contains 30 plots, so we have in total 1,800 plots. We also have photos in raw format (.DNG) – let me if that would be better than jpg.
 
Kind regards,
 
Philippa
